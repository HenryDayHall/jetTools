Dear Prof Salam,

Thank you for your Southampton seminar back in February, it was very helpful.

Would it be alright to ask a somewhat naive question about jet showers?

I am a PhD student working on jet tagging. At the moment I am generating Monte Carlo data to practice tagging via madgraph. I think I'm doing it a fairly standard way; importing my model (2HDM), generating the hard process, outputting then launching. The launch includes Pythia8 (which produces the .hepmc file with the shower in it).

To better understand the data, I wrote some tools to plot the showers in the .hepmc file as graphs; one is attached (also drawing some information from the output of Delphes). Looking at these showers it surprises me that some particles have many daughters. In the shower attached, one of the particles has 9 daughters. I had expected that all the processes would be tree level, so all the particles would have at most 2 daughters and 2 mothers. Clearly I am missing something big, please can you point me in the right direction?

All the best,
Henry
